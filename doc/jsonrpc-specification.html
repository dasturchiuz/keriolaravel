   <H1>1 <SPAN>Overview</SPAN></H1> 

   <P>JSON-RPC is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC)
   protocol. Primarily this specification defines several data structures
   and the rules around their processing. It is transport agnostic in that
   the concepts can be used within the same process, over sockets, over
   http, or in many various message passing environments. It uses 
   <A HREF="http://www.json.org" REL="nofollow">JSON</A> (<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt"
                                                             REL="nofollow">RFC
   4627</A>) as data format.</P> 

   <P>It is designed to be simple!</P> 
</DIV>
<DIV> 
   <H1>2<SPAN> Conventions</SPAN></H1> 

   <P>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in 
   <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt" REL="nofollow">RFC 2119</A>.<BR>
   
   <BR> </P>

   <P>Since JSON-RPC utilizes JSON, it has the same type system (see 
   <A HREF="http://www.json.org" REL="nofollow">http://www.json.org</A> or 
   <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt" REL="nofollow">RFC 4627</A>).
   JSON can represent four primitive types (Strings, Numbers, Booleans, and
   Null) and two structured types (Objects and Arrays). The term
   "Primitive" in this specification references any of those four primitive
   JSON types. The term "Structured" references either of the structured
   JSON types. Whenever this document refers to any JSON type, the first
   letter is always capitalized: Object, Array, String, Number, Boolean,
   Null. True and False are also capitalized.<BR> 
   <BR> </P>

   <P>All member names exchanged between the Client and the Server that are
   considered for matching of any kind should be considered to be
   case-sensitive. The terms function, method, and procedure can be assumed
   to be interchangeable.<BR> 
   <BR> </P>

   <P>The Client is defined as the origin of Request objects and the
   handler of Response objects. 
   <BR> The Server is defined as the origin of Response objects and the
   handler of Request objects. 
   <BR> 
   <BR> One implementation of this specification could easily fill both of
   those roles, even at the same time, to other different clients or the
   same client. This specification does not address that layer of
   complexity.</P> 
</DIV>
<DIV> 
   <H1>3 <SPAN>Compatibility</SPAN></H1> 

   <P>JSON-RPC 2.0 Request objects and Response objects may not work with
   existing JSON-RPC 1.0 clients or servers. However, it is easy to
   distinguish between the two versions as 2.0 always has a member named
   &quot;jsonrpc&quot; with a String value of &quot;2.0&quot; whereas 1.0
   does not. Most 2.0 implementations should consider trying to handle 1.0
   objects, even if not the peer-to-peer and class hinting aspects of 1.0.</P>
   
</DIV>
<DIV> 
   <H1>4<SPAN> Request object</SPAN></H1> 

   <P>A rpc call is represented by sending a Request object to a Server.
   The Request object has the following members:</P> 
   <DL><DT>jsonrpc</DT> 
      <DD>A String specifying the version of the JSON-RPC protocol. MUST be
      exactly "2.0".</DD> 
   </DL>
   <DL><DT>method</DT> 
      <DD>A String containing the name of the method to be invoked. Method
      names that begin with the word rpc followed by a period character
      (U+002E or ASCII 46) are reserved for rpc-internal methods and
      extensions and MUST NOT be used for anything else.</DD> 
   </DL>
   <DL><DT>params</DT> 
      <DD>A Structured value that holds the parameter values to be used
      during the invocation of the method. This member MAY be omitted.</DD> 
      <DL><DT>id</DT> 
         <DD>An identifier established by the Client that MUST contain a
         String, Number, or NULL value if included. If it is not included
         it is assumed to be a notification. The value SHOULD normally not
         be Null <A HREF="#id1" REL="nofollow">[1]</A> and Numbers SHOULD
         NOT contain fractional parts <A HREF="#id2" REL="nofollow">[2]</A><BR>
         
         <BR> 

         <P>The Server MUST reply with the same value in the Response
         object if included. This member is used to correlate the context
         between the two objects.<BR> 
         <BR> </P>
         <DIV> 

            <P>[1] The use of Null as a value for the id member in a
            Request object is discouraged, because this specification uses
            a value of Null for Responses with an unknown id. Also, because
            JSON-RPC 1.0 uses an id value of Null for Notifications this
            could cause confusion in handling.</P> 
         </DIV>
         <BR> 
         <DIV> 

            <P>[2] Fractional parts may be problematic, since many decimal
            fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions.</P> 
         </DIV></DD>
      </DL>
      <DIV> 
         <H2>4.1<SPAN> Notification</SPAN></H2> 

         <P>A Notification is a Request object without an "id" member. A
         Request object that is a Notification signifies the Client's lack
         of interest in the corresponding Response object, and as such no
         Response object needs to be returned to the client. The Server
         MUST NOT reply to a Notification, including those that are within
         a batch request.</P> 

         <P>Notifications are not confirmable by definition, since they do
         not have a Response object to be returned. As such, the Client
         would not be aware of any errors (like e.g. "Invalid params.",
         "Internal error.").</P> 
      </DIV>
      <DIV> 
         <H2>4.2 <SPAN>Parameter Structures</SPAN></H2> 

         <P>If present, parameters for the rpc call MUST be provided as a
         Structured value. Either by-position through an Array or by-name
         through an Object.</P> 
         <UL>
            <LI>by-position: params MUST be an Array, containing the values
            in the Server expected order.</LI> 
            <LI>by-name: params MUST be an Object, with member names that
            match the Server expected parameter names. The absence of
            expected names MAY result in an error being generated. The
            names MUST match exactly, including case, to the method's
            expected parameters.</LI> 
         </UL>
      </DIV>
   </DL>
</DIV>
<DIV> 
   <H1>5<SPAN> Response object</SPAN></H1> 

   <P>When a rpc call is made, the Server MUST reply with a Response,
   except for in the case of Notifications. The Response is expressed as a
   single JSON Object, with the following members:</P> 
   <DL><DT>jsonrpc</DT> 
      <DD>A String specifying the version of the JSON-RPC protocol. MUST be
      exactly "2.0".</DD> 
   </DL>
   <DL><DT>result</DT> 
      <DD>This member is REQUIRED on success.<BR> This member MUST NOT
      exist if there was an error invoking the method.<BR> The value of
      this member is determined by the method invoked on the Server.</DD> 
   </DL>
   <DL><DT>error</DT> 
      <DD>This member is REQUIRED on error.<BR> This member MUST NOT exist
      if there was no error triggered during invocation.<BR> The value for
      this member MUST be an Object as defined in section 5.1.</DD> 
   </DL>
   <DL><DT>id</DT> 
      <DD>This member is REQUIRED.<BR> It MUST be the same as the value of
      the id member in the Request Object.<BR> If there was an error in
      detecting the id in the Request object (e.g. Parse error/Invalid
      Request), it MUST be Null.</DD> 
   </DL>

   <P>Either the result member or error member MUST be included, but both
   members MUST NOT be included.</P> 
   <DIV> 
      <H2>5.1<SPAN> Error object</SPAN></H2> 

      <P>When a rpc call encounters an error, the Response Object MUST
      contain the error member with a value that is a Object with the
      following members:</P> 
      <DL><DT>code</DT> 
         <DD>A Number that indicates the error type that occurred.<BR> This
         MUST be an integer.</DD> <DT>message</DT> 
         <DD>A String providing a short description of the error.<BR> The
         message SHOULD be limited to a concise single sentence.</DD> <DT>data</DT>
         
         <DD>A Primitive or Structured value that contains additional
         information about the error.<BR> This may be omitted.<BR> The
         value of this member is defined by the Server (e.g. detailed error
         information, nested errors etc.).</DD> 
      </DL>

      <P>The error codes from and including -32768 to -32000 are reserved
      for pre-defined errors. Any code within this range, but not defined
      explicitly below is reserved for future use. The error codes are

   <H1>6<SPAN> Batch</SPAN></H1> 

   <P>To send several Request objects at the same time, the Client MAY send
   an Array filled with Request objects.<BR> 
   <BR> The Server should respond with an Array containing the
   corresponding Response objects, after all of the batch Request objects
   have been processed. A Response object SHOULD exist for each Request
   object, except that there SHOULD NOT be any Response objects for
   notifications. The Server MAY process a batch rpc call as a set of
   concurrent tasks, processing them in any order and with any width of
   parallelism.</P>

   <P>
   <BR></P>

   <P>The Response objects being returned from a batch call MAY be returned
   in any order within the Array. The Client SHOULD match contexts between
   the set of Request objects and the resulting set of Response objects
   based on the id member within each Object.<BR> 
   <BR> </P>

   <P>If the batch rpc call itself fails to be recognized as an valid JSON
   or as an Array with at least one value, the response from the Server
   MUST be a single Response object. If there are no Response objects
   contained within the Response array as it is to be sent to the client,
   the server MUST NOT return an empty Array and should return nothing at
   all.</P><BR>
